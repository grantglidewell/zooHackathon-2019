#### The Problem

Animals are traded illegally online. Many of the trades take place on bulletin boards that are very difficult to scrape using automated methods. AI and Machine Learning require lots of training data in order to become proficient at a specific task.

#### The Solution

Fauna Lens allows crowd sourcing of valuable data sets. These data sets are useful immediately in analyzing trends in trading markets, as well as contributing to training data so that the process can be automated with much greater efficiency later.
